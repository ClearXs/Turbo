<h4 align="center">Based on the Java ecosystem, the latest technologies in the React ecosystem are dedicated to creating comprehensive, one-stop solutions suitable for enterprise-level and internet marketing needs, tailored for future trends.</h4>

## Target

- 🧃 Developer-friendly, clear code, and high readability.
- 🤖 Reducing operational costs, embracing cloud-native approaches comprehensively, supporting CI/CD, and implementing
  robust system monitoring solutions.
- 💪 An all-encompassing solution covering App, iOS, Mini Programs, HarmonyOS, and desktop applications within the entire
  ecosystem.
- ❤️User-oriented, featuring minimalist design to reduce redundant actions, increase efficiency, and prevent repetitive
  user experiences for enhanced usability.

## Feature

- 🚀**Fast:** Turbo places "fast" at its core, significantly enhancing development efficiency through features such as low-code and code generation, enabling developers to rapidly construct application systems.
- 🤙**Support for Multiple Data Categories and Sources:** The data abstraction layer based on uno-data enables developers to seamlessly integrate various data categories and multiple data sources without being aware of the integration process.
- ⚽**Data Source Agnostic:** Highly abstracted data operations allow developers to focus solely on business logic without needing to concern themselves with the differences in underlying data sources.
- 🎈**High Encapsulation:** Turbo draws inspiration from the design principles of Mybatis-Plus and JPA, adopting a highly encapsulated three-tier architecture (Controller-Service-Repository) along with concepts of domain events and behaviors. This approach achieves architectural uniformity and extensibility.
- 🌤**Business Domain Modeling:** Turbo supports business domain modeling, aiding developers in better organizing and managing business logic.
- 🍙**Unified Frontend:** Leveraging Alibaba's Formily and internally developed Tableily solutions, Turbo achieves uniformity across different ends, reducing the learning curve for developers by unifying **Form** and **Table** components.
- 🔒**RBAC Permission System:** Turbo offers a comprehensive RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permission system, enabling developers to easily implement user permission management.
- 🖲**Supports the OAuth2.1:** Turbo supports the OAuth2.1 protocol, facilitating seamless integration with other systems.
