## Feature

- **Fast:** Turbo places "fast" at its core, significantly enhancing development efficiency through features such as low-code and code generation, enabling developers to rapidly construct application systems.
- **Support for Multiple Data Categories and Sources:** The data abstraction layer based on uno-data enables developers to seamlessly integrate various data categories and multiple data sources without being aware of the integration process.
- **Data Source Agnostic:** Highly abstracted data operations allow developers to focus solely on business logic without needing to concern themselves with the differences in underlying data sources.
- **High Encapsulation:** Turbo draws inspiration from the design principles of Mybatis-Plus and JPA, adopting a highly encapsulated three-tier architecture (Controller-Service-Repository) along with concepts of domain events and behaviors. This approach achieves architectural uniformity and extensibility.
- **Business Domain Modeling:** Turbo supports business domain modeling, aiding developers in better organizing and managing business logic.
- **Unified Frontend:** Leveraging Alibaba's Formily and internally developed Tablily solutions, Turbo achieves uniformity across different ends, reducing the learning curve for developers by unifying **Form** and **Table** components.

- **Supports the OAuth2.1:** Turbo supports the OAuth2.1 protocol, facilitating seamless integration with other systems.
- **Internationalization**: Turbo supports internationalization, making it convenient to implement multi-language support.
